Tool vendors claim that there will be 55% software productivity improvement with these coding assistants, but we see only 20% of productivity improvement based on 250+ projects who adopted GenAI tools in TCS. In addition, these assistant tools may create challenges like third party IP infringements, inconsistencies, vulnerability risks and technical debts. Industry Code assistants like GitHub Copilot can generate code but there is always a challenge of accuracy, technical debt and quality issues like code bloat. Generally, these industry tools provide more code than necessary, and generated code cannot be trusted. They provide 10% to 20% more code and require an additional 10% human effort in reviewing and testing the code. So, this negates the original productivity gain provided by the code assistant. To address the above issue, we have developed a TCS Proprietary Professional Code Engine which provides tested high-quality code at first attempt. This provides well-tested just enough code covering all edge scenarios, adhering to enterprise level coding standards resulting in zero to negligible technical debt and prevents regression. Below is the key beneficial impact of this tool which we witnessed in few implemented areas. 1)Testers count has come down from 8 to 2. 2)Defect counts reduced from 36 to 7. 3)Lines of code reduced from 154 to 67. 4)Independent talents count increased in a short span of time.');">Professional Code Engine</a>

        'Adding Voice Interface for Feature-Rich Software Products to Enhance Productivity', 
        'R Nandakumar, Independent Researcher (Ex-ISRO-SAC)', 
        'The purpose of adding a voice user interface (VUI) to a software product has typically been for the following reasons: ~ Improved Accessibility for people with disabilities; ~ Hands-Free Operation; ~ Enhanced User Experience (faster navigation for repetitive tasks or complex workflows); ~ Natural Interaction; and ~ Competitive Edge (which can differentiate your product in a competitive market). Considerations for adding VUI typically include: ~ Context-Specific Value -- Not all software benefits from voice input. For example, voice might be essential for productivity tools, IoT devices, or customer support apps, but less relevant for purely visual or data-heavy applications; ~ Accuracy and Usability -- Voice interfaces must work seamlessly in noisy environments with diverse accents; ~ Privacy Concerns -- Users may hesitate to use voice features due to concerns about data collection and security; and ~ Learning Curve -- Users unfamiliar with voice commands may prefer traditional interfaces. In this paper, we propose adding VUI to feature-rich software products to primarily enhance user productivity, both for new and expert users. We discuss the steps involved in adding VUI to software products and illustrate potential benefits with a few use-case scenarios, as applied to two feature-rich software products under both COTS (Office 365) and FOSS (Blender) categories. VUI is proposed to be an additional user interface feature over pre-existing graphical user interface (GUI) features. Their combined use will help increase the usability of software products. While GUI is used to set the context and identify specific spatial locations, VUI is used to convey one or more desired operations. Adding VUI invokes different streams of AI, namely: (i) Discriminative AI: For speech-to-text processing and intent recognition; (ii) Natural Language Processing (NLP): For understanding and mapping text-based commands to software features; (iii) Generative AI: For generating responses or handling ambiguous or open-ended commands; (iv) Reinforcement Learning: For learning and adapting to user preferences and improving feature activation; and (v) Symbolic AI: For static, rule-based command-to-feature mapping. Adding VUI to a feature-rich software product could be accomplished using one or more of the following resources: Speech Recognition Libraries/Services – such as (a) Google Speech-to-Text API; (b) Microsoft Azure Speech Services; (c) Amazon Transcribe; (d) Open-Source Options: e.g., Mozilla DeepSpeech or Kaldi for cost efficiency; and (e) NLP Libraries -- to process and understand user intents (e.g., spaCy, Dialogflow, or Rasa). Combining VUI and GUI will help: (i) new users quickly learn the software product and immediately put it to practical use; and (ii) expert users accomplish complex and time-consuming tasks much faster than usual.'

        'MuGNN: API Misuse Detection using Graph Neural Network', 
        'Ponnampalam Pirapuraj, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad', 
        'Modern software development increasingly relies on Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as their utilization reduces development time. In particular, APIs from the Java standard library play a vital role in enterprise application software. However, developers often depend on online platforms or AI tools for API usage guidance, which can lead to potential vulnerabilities. This is particularly concerning, as developers may unknowingly introduce security vulnerabilities such as resource leaks, memory corruption, data races, and improper access controls by implementing API usage examples that deviate from standard practices. To address this challenge, we propose MuGNN, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting API misuse and analyzing usage patterns. MuGNN introduces an API Flow Graph (AFG) representation to capture data flow, control flow, and API call sequences, enabling comprehensive embeddings of code behaviour and begins its workflow by extracting AFGs from code snippets using an AST-based generator to represent intricate relationships within the code, which are then processed to generate embeddings. Using self-supervised pretraining and the Birch clustering algorithm, MuGNN distinguishes frequent patterns (large clusters) from potential misuses (small clusters). Our experiments showcase the effectiveness of MuGNN through two variants: a 5-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a 5-layer Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN), referred to as MuGNN and MuRGCN, respectively. MuGNN achieves superior performance in clustering API usage patterns, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art LLMs and misuse detectors in Rand Index and Mutual Information scores. Further, MuRGCN, in particular, excels in detecting API misuse in both real-world and LLM-generated examples, achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores across diverse APIs. MuGNN’s lightweight architecture and computational efficiency make it suitable for real-world applications. Furthermore, MuGNN’s capability to identify misuse without requiring manual intervention enhances software reliability and safety.'

        ' Sri ram Macharla ( Technology Architect, Involgixs Inc, NJ, USA  ), Sridhar Murthy J (Sr Principal Technology Architect, CTO Office, Infosys Ltd, Bangalore, India) and Anjaneyulu Pasala (Department of AI & ML Computer Engineering, M.S Ramaiah University, Bangalore, India) ', 
        'Typically, most AI products suffer from the challenges of managing and integrating vast, disparate data sources within the product engineering. Existing product engineering platforms struggle to provide seamless access to critical information such as total spent, patients\' health data across domains/platforms. Hence, limiting the ability to respond dynamically to user needs. We introduce a novel AI platform (MultiFluxAI) that addresses these challenges in Product Engineering that can be used across multiple domains. MultiFluxAI leverages AI techniques such as GenAI, vectorization, and agentic orchestration framework to optimize users’ interaction and provide dynamic intelligent responses to their requests. The MultiFluxAI is designed to integrate with multiple agentic orchestration frameworks, each serving distinct functionality and enabling seamless access to data across the product engineering platform. It can orchestrate multiple intelligent agents simultaneously so that the required information is accessible via the platform seamlessly. Though, the proposed platform addresses orchestration of multiple data sources, currently we limit it to three such key data sources. Therefore, the MultiFluxAI is built with three orchestrators, each connecting to one data source. The 1st orchestration focuses on the overall vision of the product, including product documentation. The 2nd orchestration addresses product integration endpoints such as interaction layers, microservices, and their metadata. The 3rd orchestration is driven by domain-specific data within the product. This facilitates unlocking previously untapped knowledge within the product. At the core of the MultiFluxAI is the GenAI that converges three distinct information sets – Product documentation, Product Interaction layer, and Product Data – into 3D vector embeddings. These embeddings are organized into respective vector collections for faster retrieval of the requested data. Each of these vector embeddings is connected to its own orchestration layer. It dynamically determines the appropriate orchestration layer to invoke, based on the user prompt and role assigned to the user. MultiFluxAI has the capability to orchestrate multiple retrieval tasks based on the user prompt. Thus, ensuring that the MultiFluxAI accesses the right data resource depending on the user privileges. MultiFluxAI has the capability to orchestrate multiple retrieval tasks sequentially or in parallel based on the user prompt. Thus, ensuring that the MultiFluxAI accesses the right data resource based on the user privileges. MultiFluxAI caters to the future needs of the products by continuously adapting to the user’s evolving needs, thus laying the groundwork for future advancements in the respective domains.'
