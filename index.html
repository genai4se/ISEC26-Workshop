            <p>
              Use of GenAI for software development has seen increasing maturity
              in the past 3+ years. Gen AI models are being applied to key
              activities architectural decision making and reverse engineering
              activities that are generally activities of senior or seasoned
              team members in the team. Several context aware tools like Cursor,
              GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q developer agent (Code Whisperer) and
              OpenAI Codex claim to have enhanced code development, code
              completion, test case generation, debugging and issue fixing
              tasks. Some methods have exploited the instruction tuning and
              reinforcement learning with feedback. Several more small and large
              models and tools are exploiting RAG techniques and Agentic AI to
              enhance the software development tasks including compiling and
              iteratively working towards a goal such as building an
              application.
            </p>
            <p>
              From SE perspective, there is a need to analyze how
              LLM-based agents can tackle different software development and
              maintenance tasks, i.e. the entire SDLC. Whereas, from the agent
              perspective, there is a need to throw light on the basic agentic
              design components,including planning, memory, perception, action
              and their roles and collaboration mechanisms, in multi-agent
              settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a parallel track, the GenAI implementations are also seeing a
              need for Software Engineering rigor on robustness, reliability,
              scalability for wider adoption. GenAI models require immense
              computational power, a scalable and optimized infrastructure
              ensures scale up or down as needed. Security and Privacy is an
              emerging concern with GenAI based models. Sufficient software
              engineering guardrails to prevent data leakage, resilience against
              cyber attacks including prompt injection attacks will enhance
              adoption of GenAI in IT systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workshop aims to provide a collaborative platform for
              researchers and practitioners to delve into the convergence of
              traditional software methodologies together with Generative AI
              technologies. By synergizing the strengths of Gen AI, LLM Agentic
              Frameworks, modeling, and knowledge representation for SDLC, our
              goal is to define a trajectory toward enhanced software
              engineering practices. We seek discussion on the following
              questions:

              <li>
                Architecting, designing, developing and maintaining
                industry-strength software is a multi-skill, long-drawn activity
                that cannot be effectively addressed by LLMs alone. What kinds
                of augmentation make it effective?
              </li>
              <li>
                LLM is a vast storehouse of general information, but the typical
                need during SDLC is rather sharply focused. How best to bear
                local knowledge at scale to get the required focus?
              </li>
              <li>
                How can Generative AI be effectively utilized for mining and
                constructing purpose-driven knowledge from software artifacts?
                Can Generative AI catalyze existing legacy modernization

                Ethical use of GenAI?
              </li>
              <li>
                How can we build reliable and secure GenAI applications?

              The workshop aims to foster interactive discussions, enabling
              participants to collectively shape the future of advanced software
              engineering. The inaugural edition in ISEC’24 and the 2nd edition
              in ISEC’25, had an enormous response, focused on discussing the
              state of the art and practice in code completion, code generation
              for satisfying non-functional properties, code translation, code
              analysis and understanding, code repair, code testing, via a set
              of invited speakers and submitted and reviewed abstracts of
              papers. In this (Third) edition, we aim to bring the issues of
              software engineering in the large and hope to discuss how
              Generative AI, LLM based Agents and RAG can be exploited together
              with MDE, KE and RE for effective software engineering. We also
              aim to bring the Software Engineering practices in GenAI adoption.
